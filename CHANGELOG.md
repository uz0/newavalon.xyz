## [0.2.3] - 2025-12-30

### Fixed
- Fixed deck data sync - server now correctly preserves `cards` array with `cardId/quantity` format when receiving deck data from client
- Fixed ability text formatting - `sanitizeString` now preserves newlines (\n) for proper multi-line ability display in tooltips
- Fixed issue where deckFiles were sent without cards array causing empty decks in game sessions

### Added
- GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/docker.yml`) for automatic Docker builds on push to master
- Docker images now pushed to GitHub Container Registry (`ghcr.io/uz0/newavalonskirmish`)


## [0.2.2] - 2025-12-29

### Fixed
- Fixed Faber and Lucius discard abilities validation - no longer incorrectly show "no target" when player has cards in hand
- Fixed target validation for hand-only actions that require discarding (SELECT_HAND_FOR_DISCARD_THEN_SPAWN, LUCIUS_SETUP, SELECT_HAND_FOR_DEPLOY)
- Fixed Zius ability - now correctly targets only cells in the same row or column as the Exploit target card
- Fixed floating score numbers not displaying - added immediate local state update in triggerFloatingText
- Fixed visual effect broadcasting to prevent duplicates by excluding sender from broadcast
- Fixed token placement mode - now persists on invalid targets instead of closing; only closes on valid target placement, right-click, or clicking outside game areas
- Fixed resurrected cards from discard (Immunis ability) - now properly initialize ready statuses so abilities can be used after returning to play

### Changed
- **Zius ability rework**: Now works like Unwavering Integrator - single-click line selection through the Exploit target card
- Updated Zius ability description in all languages to reflect simplified mechanic
- Auto-phase transition now applies to both Units and Command cards when played from hand during Setup phase
- Floating score numbers display duration set to 2 seconds
  - English: "Deploy: Exploit any card.\nSupport ⇒ Setup: Exploit any card. Gain 1 point for each of your exploits in that line."
  - Russian: "Deploy: Exploit на любую карту.\nSupport ⇒ Setup: Exploit на любую карту. Получите 1 очко за каждый ваш Exploit в этой линии."
  - Serbian: "Deploy: Exploit na bilo koju kartu.\nSupport ⇒ Setup: Exploit na bilo koju kartu. Dobij 1 bod za svaki tvoj Exploit u ovoj liniji."

### Added
- New ability mode: `ZIUS_LINE_SELECT` - single-click line selection anchored at target card position
- Special case handling in `checkActionHasTargets` for hand-only actions requiring discard
- Token ownership system: tokens from token panel are owned by active player, tokens from abilities owned by card owner
- Any player can now control dummy player's cards/tokens when dummy is the active player


## [0.2.1] - 2025-12-26

### Fixed
- Fixed IP Dept Agent Support ability - now targets any card in hand with Reveal token from same player
- Fixed Setup abilities - now only work in Setup phase (phase 0), not in Main phase
- Fixed Patrol Agent Setup ability - now properly consumes ready status when used
- Fixed Maria "Eleftheria" Damanaki Setup ability - now only works in Setup phase
- Fixed card movement - all card statuses (including ready statuses) are now preserved when moving cards on the board
- Fixed Secret Informant deploy ability - decks now properly highlight when selecting a target
- Fixed React Hooks order violation in DeckViewModal - all hooks now defined before early return

### Changed
- **Ability System Overhaul**: Replaced global ability flags with card-based ready status system (readyDeploy, readySetup, readyCommit)
- Setup abilities now work only in Setup phase (phase 0) instead of Setup + Main phases (phases 0-1)
- Main phase (phase 1) is now for manual actions only, no phase abilities
- **Content Loading Refactor**: Moved content database loading from client import to server API
- Client now fetches card/token/counter data from `/api/content/database` endpoint
- Removed client-side `contentDatabase.json` - now served exclusively by server
- Improved drag-and-drop: cards can now be dragged from deck/discard/top-deck views directly to board or hand
- `allowHandTargets` added to AbilityAction type for targeting cards in hand

### Added
- Dynamic version display in main menu - version is now sourced from `client/version.ts`
- Auto-draw feature enabled by default for all players
- Auto-draw and auto-abilities settings persist in localStorage
- Auto-phase transition: when playing a unit from hand in Setup phase with auto-abilities enabled, game automatically transitions to Main phase
- Visual ready status indicators on cards showing which abilities are available
- Deck selection highlighting (cyan glow) for abilities that target decks (Secret Informant)
- Server-side targeting utilities (`server/utils/targeting.ts`) with validation logic
- Toggle auto-draw handler (`handleToggleAutoDraw`) for per-player auto-draw settings
- New locale: Serbian (Српски) with complete UI and rules translation
- `client/version.ts` - centralized version constant
